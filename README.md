Usage:

 * Use 'make' to compile all the necessary files and create the 'crawler' and 'indexer' executables
 * Use the 'crawler' executable in the 'crawler' directory to fill a directory with files of webpages
 * Use the 'indexer' executable in the 'indexer' directory to create a new file with the indices from the output of 'crawler'
 * Use the 'indextest' executable in the 'indexer' directory to create another file with indices from the file create by 'indexer'
